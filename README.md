# Winux-chan: Discord News Bot

**A Curious Beginner’s Journey Building a Discord News Bot**

Winux-chan is a Discord bot written in Python that automatically posts news about Windows and Linux using RSS feeds from reliable tech websites.

The bot is now configurable per server via commands, so no code editing is required to set it up.
---

## Features

- Automatic news about Windows and Linux
- Server-based configuration (multi-server support)
- Configurable news channel via command
- Fixed check interval (e.g., every 1 hour)
- Multiple RSS sources
- Fault-tolerant (does not crash if a feed is offline)
- Saves already sent news to avoid reposting

---

## Technologies

- Python 3
- [discord.py](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py)
- [feedparser](https://github.com/kurtmckee/feedparser) (for handling RSS feeds)
- JSON file for tracking sent news
- [python-dotenv](https://pypi.org/project/python-dotenv/)
